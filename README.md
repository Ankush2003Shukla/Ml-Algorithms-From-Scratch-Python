# Ml-Algorithms-From-Scratch-Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch. The algorithms implemented include:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
- Lasso Regression
- K-Means Classifier

These implementations are provided for educational purposes to understand the inner workings of these algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script(Google colab) for clarity.

## Usage

To use the implementations, simply clone the repository and run the Python scripts for the respective algorithms. You can modify the scripts or integrate them into your own projects as needed.

## Requirements

The implementations require the following Python libraries:

- NumPy

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy

```bash
pip install statistics
